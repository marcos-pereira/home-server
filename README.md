# home-server
This repository will be used to learn and develop a server in Python with the Django framework.

This README will contain basic information about how to get started with this project. It will be updated as the project evolves.

# Before you start 
The goal of this project is to create a server in Python using the [Django web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). It will use Python 3.4.3. 

The Server will read data from sensors and write data to actuators. A web application should be developed to interface with the server and the sensors and actuators. It is planned to use the Django templates to organize the html files of the web application.

To learn how to use Django, the [Django tutorials](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/) will be executed in the sandbox folder.

# Starting the project 
After the sandbox folder contains the polling web application and the Django server is up and running locally, the goal is to add new objects to the server. For example, add an object model which work as a switch that can be turned on and off. In the same way of the polling app, create a web application to change the switch state (on/off).
